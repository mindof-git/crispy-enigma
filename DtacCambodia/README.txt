HI!!!
I would like to inform you that this code is not 100% accuracy. We didn't use the machine learning method in it (I am too young to know that stuff ^^) and due the short time of the project.
Here is the instructions to use :
1. There are 9 text files, which are the keyword that I found in the raw files. It is important to insert it into the "Sentiment" code in order to sentiment the comment.
2. You can just insert the comment file into the code(I already commented where you should insert the file)
3. If you have raw file (file that you already sent it to me), you must extract it first before you do the sentiment.
4. It is written in Python. It is easy to understand.

I hope you have a good time doing it in the future. Last, but not least, some comments might not sentiment correctly, so I hopefully you understand it. I think it is better to use further technique or method using machine learning or other things else.

Thank you!!!
Best Regards,
